# Generator-and-Power-Grid-Analyzer-Python-Based-Power-System-Simulation
This project performs a steady-state analysis of a synchronous generator delivering power to a high-voltage grid via a step-up transformer. Using the Per-Unit system, the software simplifies complex impedance calculations and visualizes the system's behavior in real-time. 


Key Features Demonstrated:

Interactive Control Panel: Real-time adjustment of Active Power, Power Factor, and Reactance. 

Dynamic Phasor Diagram: Visualizes the vector relationship between Internal EMF, Terminal Voltage, and Grid Voltage. 

Advanced Engineering Mode: Calculates Voltage Regulation (VR) and Efficiency while accounting for extra system losses. 

Safety Alerts: Automated warnings for "Under-Excited" (capacitive) loading risks.
