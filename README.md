# Generator-and-Power-Grid-Analyzer-Python-Based-Power-System-Simulation
This project performs a steady-state analysis of a synchronous generator delivering power to a high-voltage grid via a step-up transformer. Using the Per-Unit system, the software simplifies complex impedance calculations and visualizes the system's behavior in real-time.
